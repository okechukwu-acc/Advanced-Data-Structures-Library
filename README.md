# Advanced Data Structures Library

## Overview

Developed a comprehensive and highly optimized library of advanced data structures, tailored for performance and memory efficiency. This library was built from the ground up to leverage Rust’s unique features and to provide robust, high-performance data handling solutions for various applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Rust
- **Benchmarking**: Criterion
- **Testing**: QuickCheck

## Key Contributions

### Custom Implementations

- **Trees**: Implemented various tree structures, including binary search trees, AVL trees, red-black trees, and B-trees, each with their respective balancing and traversal algorithms.
- **Graphs**: Developed both directed and undirected graph structures, supporting edge and adjacency list representations, and implemented algorithms for traversal (DFS, BFS), shortest path (Dijkstra’s, A*), and cycle detection.
- **Heaps**: Created binary heaps, Fibonacci heaps, and binomial heaps, optimized for priority queue operations and memory usage.
- **Hash Maps**: Built hash map implementations using open addressing and chaining techniques, with custom hash functions to minimize collisions and optimize lookup times.

### Optimization Techniques

- Leveraged Rust’s ownership model, lifetimes, and borrowing rules to ensure memory safety, eliminate data races, and enhance performance.
- Utilized advanced memory management techniques, such as arena allocation for trees and graphs, to reduce allocation overhead and fragmentation.
- Applied caching strategies and lazy evaluation where appropriate to improve runtime efficiency.

### Performance Benchmarking

- Designed and executed comprehensive benchmarks to measure and compare the performance of each data structure under various workloads and usage scenarios.
- Used Rust’s criterion benchmarking library to ensure rigorous and repeatable performance testing, providing detailed reports on time complexity and resource utilization.
- Conducted extensive profiling to identify and eliminate performance bottlenecks, leading to significant improvements in execution speed and memory usage.

### Testing and Validation

- Developed a thorough suite of unit and integration tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of each data structure.
- Employed property-based testing with libraries like QuickCheck to validate the invariants and properties of data structures under a wide range of input conditions.
- Implemented continuous integration pipelines to automate testing and ensure that all code changes maintained or improved performance and correctness.
